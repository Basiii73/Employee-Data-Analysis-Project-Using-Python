# Employee Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing employee data from ABC company, which consists of 458 rows and 9 columns. The analysis focuses on understanding team distribution, positions, salary expenditure, and correlations between different attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset contains employee-related information such as:
- Team
- Position
- Salary
- Age
- Height (preprocessed for consistency)

## Preprocessing Steps
1. **Height Correction:** The "height" column was replaced with random values between 150 and 180 for data consistency.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Checked for missing values and ensured data integrity.

## Analysis Tasks
1. **Team Distribution:** Counted the number of employees per team and calculated the percentage split.
2. **Position Segregation:** Segmented employees based on their job positions.
3. **Age Group Analysis:** Identified the predominant age group among employees.
4. **Salary Expenditure:** Determined which team and position had the highest total salary expenditure.
5. **Age vs. Salary Correlation:** Analyzed the relationship between age and salary.

## Graphical Representations
- **Bar Chart:** Employee distribution by team and position.
- **Pie Chart:** Percentage of employees per team.
- **Histogram:** Age group analysis.
- **Bar Chart:** Highest salary expenditure by team and position.
- **Scatter Plot:** Age vs. Salary correlation.
